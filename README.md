# code-quiz
A short quiz to test how well you know javascript. When you start the quiz, a timer begins counting down from 60. There are 6 questions. If you get a question wrong, 10 seconds are taken away from the timer. The quiz end when you have either finished every question, or the timer reaches 0. Your final score is determined by how much time is left on the timer when the quiz is finished. Once you are done, you may add your name and score to the scoreboard!
